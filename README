Project based on lcdinfo from Phil's blog:

This is code designed to display rolling info about the state of your
Raspberry Pi whilst it is running some sort of GNU/Linux OS, such as
Debian Squeeze, Raspbian, etc. It doesn't rely on any truly esoteric
libraries that you shouldn't already have installed.
