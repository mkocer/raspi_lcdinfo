Hi.

How are you? You good? Good/That's too bad*

This is code designed to display rolling info about the state of your
Raspberry Pi whilst it is running some sort of GNU/Linux OS, such as
Debian Squeeze, Raspbian, etc. It doesn't rely on any truly esoteric
libraries that you shouldn't already have installed.

To compile, type "make" in this directory.

To run, make sure you have your Hitachi HD44780 compatible LCD module
hooked up as per the wiring diagram you can see at:
http://pbambridge.brunelweb.net/blog/?p=64

Then type "sudo ./lcdinfo"

If it works and you like what you see, you can add the line:
  /path/lcdinfo &
(where /path is the path you've intstalled it) to /etc/rc.local or
some similar boot file.

main.c is really only meant to be a demonstrator of the LCD module
functionality, but you will hopefully find it useful.

If you need to change the pin assignments, look in main.c, in main(),
for where lcdInit() is called.

Then have a cup of tea. It's probably time for tea.

Using this code for your own displays involves copying lcd.h, lcd.c,
rpi.h, rpi.c and the Makefile. You can then write your own main.c.

Essentially, one call to lcdInit() will return the lcdmodule struct
that you pass on as the first argument to most of the LCD display
functions, such as prints(). lcdInit() takes a list of pin assignments
but may in future contain character layout information (i.e. whether
it is 16x2, 20x4, 40x2, etc).

Then have another cup of tea, as you have earned it.

Lots of love,
Phil
